# CSE691 Image and Processing Motion TransferProject
NN, CycelGan, Pix2Pix and Everybody Dance Now for motion transfer.


## Download Pre-trained Models
For pre-trained models of Openpose and PerceptualSimilarity:
[Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ghrackr5yem5lpy/AADa743FXzhLsS9vrhvg3y8ma?dl=0)

1. For Openpose:
Please put pose_model.pth into Baseline-NN/Openpose/network/ for NN and Openpose_Gen_Skeleton/lib/network/weight/
pose_model.pth is used to extract the keypoints of the body.
NN would choose the image which has the mininmum L2 distance between training images and current skeleton.

2. For PerceptualSimilarityï¼š
Please put alex.pth, squeeze.pth, vgg.pth into ./models/weights/v0.1/ for each methods.
They are used to calculate the metrics between synthisezed images and grount-truths.
